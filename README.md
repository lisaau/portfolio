# Profile Webpage

This project is from [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/)'s open source curriculum. The instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/projects/portfolio/portfolio-webpage-1.md). In this project, we built a simple portfolio page to practice what we've learned about VSCode, HTML, CSS, Git, and Bootstrap.
